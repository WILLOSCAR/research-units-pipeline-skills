# Global Review

- Status: PASS
- Draft subsections (H3): 8; median length (chars, sans cites): 6069
- Outline subsections (H3): 8
- Unique citation keys in draft: 114; missing in ref.bib: 0
- Weakest subsections by length: `Planning and reasoning loops`, `Benchmarks and evaluation protocols`, `Self-improvement and adaptation`

## A. Input integrity / placeholder leakage
- Draft exists: yes
- Evidence mode: abstract
- Visual artifacts present: tables/timeline/figures = 2/0/no

## B. Narrative and argument chain
- Citation density per subsection: looks OK (no <3-cite subsections detected).
- Expand the weakest subsections first (more A-vs-B contrasts + one cross-paper synthesis paragraph + explicit limitation).

## C. Scope and taxonomy consistency
- H3 count: 8 (survey target: <=12; fewer, thicker sections usually write better).
- Scope check: ensure section titles match mapped papers; avoid mixing orthogonal axes without an explicit rule.

## D. Citations and verifiability (claim -> evidence)
- Citation keys appear consistent with ref.bib (no undefined keys detected).
- Spot-check: each subsection should contain at least one paragraph that compares multiple works (>=2 citations in the same paragraph).

## E. Tables and structural outputs
- Tables: separator rows found = 2 (target: >=2 tables).
- Timeline: year-like milestone bullets = 0 (target: >=8).
- Figures: provide concrete figure specs (what the figure must show + which cited works anchor it).

## Terminology glossary
- Canonicalize key terms (one preferred name + allowed synonyms) and define them once early; then keep usage stable.

## Ready-for-LaTeX checklist
- Undefined citations: 0
- Placeholder leakage: none expected (avoid placeholder tokens in outputs)
- Subsection depth: aim for 6–10 paragraphs per H3 with a cross-paper synthesis paragraph
