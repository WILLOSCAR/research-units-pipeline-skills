- Then mark `U098` as `DONE` in `UNITS.csv` (or run `python scripts/pipeline.py mark --workspace <ws> --unit-id U098 --status DONE --note "LLM refined"`).

## Issues

- `post_merge_slash_list_axes`: slash-list axis markers (source: draft)

## Next action

- Open `output/POST_MERGE_VOICE_REPORT.md` and fix the earliest responsible artifact it points to.
- If the report says `source: transitions`: rewrite `outline/transitions.md` as content-bearing argument bridges (no planner talk, no A/B/C slash labels), then rerun `section-merger` and this gate.
- If the report says `source: draft`: route to `writer-selfloop` / `subsection-polisher` / `draft-polisher` for the flagged section, then rerun `section-merger` and this gate.
- Treat the current outputs as a starting point (often a scaffold).
- Follow `.codex/skills/post-merge-voice-gate/SKILL.md` to refine the required artifacts until the issues above no longer apply.
- Then mark `U103` as `DONE` in `UNITS.csv` (or run `python scripts/pipeline.py mark --workspace <ws> --unit-id U103 --status DONE --note "LLM refined"`).
