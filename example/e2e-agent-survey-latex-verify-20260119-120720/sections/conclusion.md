## Conclusion

LLM agents should be understood as closed-loop systems whose behavior is shaped by action spaces, tool interfaces, planning and memory mechanisms, adaptation strategies, and evaluation protocols. Across the literature, interface contracts and protocol choices repeatedly determine whether empirical claims are comparable and whether improvements transfer beyond a single benchmark setup.

For practitioners, the key takeaway is to treat interfaces, budgets, permissions, and logging as part of the agent design, not as implementation plumbing. For researchers, the key open problems lie in evaluation: protocol standardization, cost-aware and safety-aware metrics, and benchmark designs that make threat models and tool behaviors explicit.
