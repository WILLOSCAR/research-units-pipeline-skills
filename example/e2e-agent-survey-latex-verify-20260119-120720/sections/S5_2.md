Multi-agent systems replace a single policy with an ensemble of interacting agents that divide labor, debate, or verify each other. The motivating tension is that richer coordination protocols can increase robustness and task coverage, whereas they also introduce new failure modes: communication overhead, collusion, inconsistent goals, and protocol gaming. The key point is that coordination trades additional compute for verification and can create correlated failures if diversity assumptions break. As with single-agent loops, coordination results are only meaningful when protocols specify roles, message budgets, and what counts as a verified outcome [@Chuang2025Debate; @Wu2025Agents].

A common comparison is role specialization versus symmetric swarms. Role-specialized systems assign explicit responsibilities (planner, critic, executor, verifier), which can improve debuggability and enable targeted evaluation; in contrast, symmetric swarms rely on redundancy and aggregation (voting or consensus) to reduce individual agent errors. These two designs imply different cost structures and different security surfaces, especially when agents can call tools or write persistent state [@Zahedifar2025Agent; @Wu2024Federated].

Debate and referee-style protocols aim to elicit better reasoning by creating structured disagreement and verification. Such methods can improve reliability in settings where a single agent is brittle, whereas they can also fail when agents share the same blind spots or when incentives encourage persuasive but incorrect arguments. In contrast, hierarchical agent designs emphasize decomposition and coordination across sub-tasks, trading off communication complexity against clearer interfaces and evaluation hooks [@Chuang2025Debate; @Zhou2024Archer].

Quantitative examples highlight the scale and diversity of coordination settings. Across multiple design iterations, one system reports developing 13,000 LLM agents to simulate crowd movement and communication during large-scale gatherings under various emergency scenarios [@Li2025What]. While such results demonstrate the breadth of multi-agent applications, they also underscore that evaluation protocols (simulation fidelity, safety constraints, and reproducibility) must be specified to interpret outcomes across domains.

A cross-paper synthesis is that coordination mechanisms often act as *verification layers*: they trade additional compute for reduced error rates by adding redundancy, critique, or structured aggregation. In contrast, coordination can also amplify risk when agents share tools or memory: an injected or compromised agent can steer the group, and message-level defenses become part of the threat model. Systems that explicitly measure coordination cost (messages, tool calls) alongside success make these trade-offs visible [@Cao2025Skyrl; @Silva2025Agents].

Evaluation of coordination should be multi-dimensional. Success-rate improvements are meaningful only when paired with coordination costs (messages, rounds, tool calls) and with a clear protocol for aggregation and verification. Debate-style protocols can reduce errors by forcing explicit counterarguments, whereas aggregation-based protocols rely on diversity and independence assumptions that may not hold when agents share the same base model or retrieval sources [@Chuang2025Debate; @Wu2025Agents]. Federated or distributed variants introduce additional constraints (communication topology, privacy, partial observability) that change what coordination means and what failure modes dominate, so comparisons should state these protocol choices explicitly [@Wu2024Federated; @Zhou2024Archer; @Cao2025Skyrl].

Coordination introduces additional failure modes beyond individual-agent errors. Group protocols can suffer from correlated mistakes (shared blind spots), persuasive-but-wrong arguments in debate, or collusion when incentives are misaligned; in contrast, redundancy can reduce variance when agent errors are closer to independent. These issues are hard to diagnose when papers report only a single aggregate score, so multi-agent evaluations should report per-role error patterns and sensitivity to message budgets and aggregation rules [@Silva2025Agents; @Chuang2025Debate; @Shen2024Small]. Moreover, many multi-agent systems implicitly assume a shared tool environment; when tool access differs by role, coordination strategies can fail in ways that are invisible on aggregate metrics. Explicitly logging message graphs and tool-call traces, and reporting per-role failure modes, would make multi-agent results more comparable across settings and would help diagnose correlated errors and collusion risks [@Wu2024Federated; @Cao2025Skyrl]. These costs matter when coordination is itself a limited resource and must be budgeted like tool calls. When budgets are fixed, adding agents often trades raw success for higher reliability only if diversity is real and aggregation rules are well specified.

Recent surveys of multi-agent LLM systems emphasize that coordination spans several orthogonal choices: communication topology (who talks to whom), message formats (free-form versus structured), and role assignment (fixed experts versus dynamic). These choices affect both performance and auditability: structured protocols can make verification easier, whereas free-form chats can hide disagreement and make failure diagnosis hard [@Sarkar2025Survey; @Hao2025Multi]. Tooling for multi-agent pipelines also starts to standardize orchestration primitives (assignment, aggregation, escalation), which helps make coordination artifacts comparable across implementations [@Papadakis2025Atlas; @Li2025Draft].

Coordination benchmarks are beginning to formalize what authentic collaboration looks like. DEBATE explicitly evaluates the authenticity of interaction in multi-agent settings rather than treating messages as uninterpreted tokens, and evaluation work on physically grounded collaboration highlights that shared environments can induce new coordination failure modes beyond text-only debate [@Chuang2025Debate; @Yim2024Evaluating; @Silva2025Agents]. In contrast, purely outcome-based tasks can overstate coordination gains when success can be achieved by a single dominant agent, making it important to report per-role contributions and sensitivity to communication budgets.

Learning to coordinate also raises alignment questions: aggregation can suppress minority but correct views, and specialized roles can be exploited if one agent can manipulate shared state. Alignment-oriented studies of multi-agent behavior and evolutionary approaches therefore recommend stress-testing protocols under adversarial roles and under evolving populations, rather than assuming benevolent cooperation [@Liu2025Aligning; @Warnakulasuriya2025Evolution; @Einwiller2025Benevolent]. Practical reinforcement learning approaches for coordinating agents suggest that reward design and budget constraints can materially change emergent behaviors, so comparisons should state the optimization objective and compute budget as part of the protocol [@Cao2025Skyrl; @Wu2024Federated].

Multi-agent coordination is sometimes motivated as a way to scale breadth—cover more subtasks in parallel—but its main benefit is often error shaping: debate and aggregation turn unstructured uncertainty into explicit disagreement that can be audited. However, this only holds when interaction protocols prevent degenerate agreement (agents echoing each other) and when the budget for communication is treated as a first-class resource, similar to tool-call budgets in single-agent systems [@Chuang2025Debate; @Cao2025Skyrl]. Systems that emphasize exploration in open-ended environments also blur the line between single- and multi-agent behavior: a single system may instantiate many ephemeral roles over time, so coordination overhead shows up as latency and cost even if the base model is shared [@Wang2023Voyager; @Papadakis2025Atlas]. Empirical studies of agent populations and evolving protocols suggest that more agents is not monotonic: coordination can fail under tight budgets, and groups can become more brittle if all agents share the same retrieval source or policy initialization [@Warnakulasuriya2025Evolution; @Wu2025Agents]. Therefore, evaluations should report scaling with number of agents and message budget, and include stress tests where one role is adversarial or misaligned to measure protocol robustness [@Liu2025Aligning; @Hao2025Multi; @Wu2024Federated].

For survey synthesis, the biggest obstacle is that coordination protocols are rarely standardized. A small change in message format, role prompts, or aggregation rule can change outcomes as much as a model change, yet these details are often omitted. Survey and tooling work therefore motivates treating the protocol itself as a benchmark artifact: publish role specs, message budget, aggregation rules, and logging schema so that other groups can reproduce coordination behavior under the same constraints [@Sarkar2025Survey; @Papadakis2025Atlas]. Without this, multi-agent results remain difficult to compare even when they are compelling within a single implementation [@Wu2025Agents].

Even lightweight protocol cards—roles, message budget, aggregation rule—would materially improve comparability across studies [@Sarkar2025Survey].

Additionally, coordination protocols should be stress-tested under constrained message budgets. This suggests that many reported multi-agent gains may be fragile unless diversity and aggregation assumptions are measured explicitly.

Therefore, many multi-agent evaluations lack standardized baselines: differences in role definitions, communication channels, and budget constraints make head-to-head comparison unclear. For practitioners, a pragmatic approach is to treat the coordination protocol as a first-class artifact: specify roles, message formats, and verification rules, then evaluate under matched budgets and explicit threat models to avoid overstating gains that depend on hidden protocol choices [@Shen2024Small; @Wang2023Voyager].
